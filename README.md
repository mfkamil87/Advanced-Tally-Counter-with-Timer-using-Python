# Advanced-Tally-Counter-with-Timer-using-Python
This counter has a built-in timer that stops counting when time runs out. You can add object names, assign A-Z keys to them, and even save/load configurations in JSON. The timer speed is adjustable from 0.1x to 3.0x, and you can also make the font larger if needed. To use it, just set up your objects and keys, duration, and press start.
